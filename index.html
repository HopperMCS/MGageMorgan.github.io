<p>Hello, I'm back again. I have made improvements to the code, and I've decided to make this my blog for the time being. I feel it's more...efficient to work directly within the design than without it. So, as you can tell, I've made the cards in line with Google's specification, as well as the header. It feels great to have done that.</p>
<br />
<p>So for those coming here that don't know, I'm working on an operating system, as well as a Cards Against Humanity parody. I'll detail these individually ib a post later on.</p>

Well, this page is fully functional it looks like, as I code this as I write at the same time; reminds me of my former third-grade self learning the ropes of HTML, and now I'm learning how to design with it simply because I'm bored, not because I don't know how to do something.
